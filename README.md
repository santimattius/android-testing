## Unit Tests to Avoid
Some unit tests should be avoided because of their low value:

- Tests that verify the correct operation of the framework or a library, not your code.
- Framework entry points such as activities, fragments, or services should not have business logic so unit testing shouldn't be a priority. Unit tests for activities have little value, because they would cover mostly framework code and they require a more involved setup. Instrumented tests such as UI tests can cover these classes.

## Integration Testing
Integration or intermediate level tests are tests that validate the interactions between stack levels within a module or the interactions between related modules.

TheMovieDB API: Check this [documentation](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

## Setup

Using local properties for define api key:

```properties
apiKey="{your-api-key}"
```

## Verification

Run check project:

```shell
> ./gradlew check
```

Run tests project:

```shell
> ./gradlew test
```
